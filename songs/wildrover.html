I've been a wild rover for many a year
and I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
and I will never play the wild rover no more.

And it's no, nay never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover,
no, never, no more!

I went into an ale house I used to frequent
and I told the landlady my money was spent.
I asked her for credit, she answered me “Nay,
such a customer like you I can have every day"

And it's no, nay never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover,
no, never, no more!

I drew from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
and the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.
She said, “you'll have whiskeys and wines of the best
and the words that I told you were only in jest.”

And it's no, nay never!
No, nay, never, no more
will I play the wild rover,
no, never, no more!

I'll go home to my parents and confess what I've done
and I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son.
And when they forgive me, as oft'times before
sure I will never play the wild rover no more.
